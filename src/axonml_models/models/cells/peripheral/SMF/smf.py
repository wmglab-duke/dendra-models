class SMF(Myelinated):
    """
    Surrogate Myelinated Fiber (S-MF) model from Hussain et al. (2024).

    This model implements a highly efficient GPU-based surrogate for the McIntyre-Richardson-Grill (MRG)
    myelinated axon model, designed to accurately replicate neural responses to electrical stimulation
    while achieving exceptional computational efficiency. The model uses simplified myelinated cable
    geometry with reparameterized non-linear ionic conductances to reproduce the behavior of the
    detailed NEURON implementation with orders-of-magnitude faster performance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    diameters : list of float, optional
        Axon diameters in μm. Must be ≥ 5.7 μm. Default is [8.0].
    n_node : int, optional
        Number of nodes in the model. Default is 101.
    temp : float, optional
        Temperature in °C. Default is 37.0.
    v_init : float, optional
        Initial membrane potential in mV. Default is -80.0.
    method : str, optional
        Numerical integration method. Only 'euler' or 'rk1' supported. Default is "euler".

    Attributes
    ----------
    node_l : float
        Node of Ranvier length in μm. Default is 1.0 μm.
    axon_d : dict
        Polynomial coefficients for axon diameter scaling.
    node_d : dict
        Polynomial coefficients for node diameter scaling.
    delta_x : dict
        Polynomial coefficients for internodal distance scaling.
    membrane : dict
        Membrane electrical properties including cm (10 μF/cm²) and rhoa (70 Ω·cm).

    Notes
    -----
    The S-MF model is designed to enable rapid exploration of electrical stimulation parameters
    while maintaining high accuracy compared to the gold-standard MRG model. It provides
    up to 1,000,000x speedup over single-core simulations in NEURON while accurately predicting:

    - Full spatiotemporal responses of nerve fibers to electrical stimulation
    - Action potential generation, propagation, and conduction velocity
    - Response to complex waveforms and electrode configurations
    - Nonlinear phenomena such as conduction block and subthreshold modulation
    - Dependence on prior excitation history

    Key features:
    - GPU-accelerated implementation under the AxonML framework
    - Compatible with monopolar and multipolar stimulation configurations
    - Handles various stimulus waveforms including conventional and kilohertz frequency signals
    - Supports different nerve morphologies and fiber diameters
    - Enables both gradient-free and gradient-based optimization approaches

    Applications:
    - Design of selective neural stimulation protocols
    - Optimization of electrode configurations and waveform parameters
    - Large-scale simulations of fiber populations
    - Development of neuromodulation therapies for various conditions
    - Studying complex nonlinear neural phenomena

    Limitations:
    - Minimum fiber diameter of 5.7 μm (use smolMRG for smaller fibers)
    - Limited to 'euler' or 'rk1' integration methods for computational efficiency
    - Simplified geometry compared to the full MRG model
